This report addresses the persistent Maintenance Problem faced by industries, proposing a solution through the implementation of the Predictive Maintenance concept. Predictive Maintenance foresees the maintenance requirements of machines in advance, employing advanced classification algorithms. Maintenance poses a continual and significant challenge for industries, incurring substantial costs and machine downtime. The implementation of Predictive Maintenance aims to mitigate these challenges by offering insights into optimal maintenance timing. Through the application of modern classification algorithms, this approach aids in better management of maintenance costs, reduction of machine downtime, and an overall improvement in production quality. The study explores the potential of predictive maintenance to transform industry practices, underscoring its role in enhancing cost efficiency, operational control, and the optimization of production quality. This research provides a valuable resource for industries seeking innovative solutions to tackle the enduring issue of maintenance, fostering a more proactive and cost-effective approach to machine upkeep.
